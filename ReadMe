This project is now in progress and most of the work hasn't been uploaded here. 
There will be an update if our paper is accepted.

The project has now come to a conclusion one paper has been submitted to ICLR 2018. I want more of public comments and guidance than the paper being admitted. This is my first time to independently write and submit one paper to such a high-level conference. Therefore, my aim is to be familiar with such a thing and get prepared to adapt to my PhD life later in America.
